Sobolev Alignment identifies commonalities between cell lines and tumors at the single cell level using Sobolev Alignment of deep generative models. Using scVI as a backbone for generative models (VAE), latent variable models are approximated by means of large-scale kernel machines, using FalkonML. This allows a systematic appro
